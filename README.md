## Archvision

# About
Archvision is a software for the mayor and his team who wants to design and plan their surface area and for constructions and many other projects along the city's guidelines and limitations.
The software allows full control on what happening in the city.

# The problem
Many developing cities divide their surface area into purposes, like education, living area, playgrounds and recreation areas. At the start or the middle of the city developing process, it's critical to be organized and well planned by considering the costs and the projects you as mayor has committed to. And that why Archvision has developed.
